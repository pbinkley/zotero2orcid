zotero2orcid
============

Import bibliographic items from a Zotero collection to an ORCID record

##Use case

You have a new ORCID id; you haven't added any of your published works; you have all your published works in a Zotero collection. This script will extract all the items from Zotero, convert them to ORCID's works format, and post them to your ORCID record. It will include the Zotero id as an external identifier, making it possible to keep them in sync if you edit them in Zotero.
